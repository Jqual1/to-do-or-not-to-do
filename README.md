# DnD Character Generator

An app to generate and store your DnD Characters.

## What It Does

This app is for basically anyone looking to make a DnD character who doesn't feel like rolling a ton of dice. This program allows you to enter a name for your character and the rolls will be automatically generated for you! If you are away from your computer or a new character sheet but you don't want to forget your idea, this is the app for you.


All of the characters you made are stored nicely in a list. You can then tap on a character to open up the rolls. They should be sorted from smallest to largest. You can then use these rolls to determine your main attributes on a character sheet.
