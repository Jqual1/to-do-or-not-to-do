# Video Game Hour Tracker

## What does it do?
The Video Game Hour Tracker allows you to input your own video games into the app and track how many hours you've played in it.

## Who is it for? Why is it useful?
If there's one game you've played for a while, at some point, you've probably asked yourself..."How much time have I put into this instead of doing anything remotely productive?" This app is for anyone who would like to record how many hours they've put into a game they love.
